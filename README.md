# uat978_wx_test

This is a clone of DUMP978 (https://github.com/mutability/dump978) written by Oliver Jowett, that I have 
expanded upon purely for my own amusement. It usees the METAR decoder library libmetar.a from 
https://github.com/flightaware/mdsplib (Eric McCarthy eric@limulus.net) and also borrows from Christopher Young's Stratux
project (https://github.com/cyoung/stratux Copyright (c) 2015-2016 Christopher Young).

My programming skills are somewhat limited, and this is my first Github project, so be nice! I am just doing this for my own amusement,
and the hope that someone more expierienced can take it further.
